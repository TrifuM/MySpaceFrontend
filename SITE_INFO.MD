# MySpace App - Project Summary

## Overview
MySpace is a modular application (not related to the MySpace social network) designed to help users manage different aspects of their lives. The app will be built around independent modules, such as money management and time management, with the flexibility to add more modules in the future.

## Key Features
- Modular architecture: Each feature area (e.g., money management, time management) is a separate module.
- Mobile-first design: The user interface and experience will be optimized for mobile devices first, then scaled up for larger screens.
- Easy extensibility: New modules can be added with minimal changes to the core app.

## Planned Modules
- Money Management
- Time Management
- (More modules to be defined)

## Design Principles
- Responsive, mobile-first layouts
- Touch-friendly navigation and interactions
- Clean, modern UI
